This notebook contains the code for the homework 1 assignment: This is what was 
done:

1. created a 5 by 10 matrix of random integers
2. defined column names as cond1, cond2, cond3, cond4, cond5, ctrl1, ctrl2, 
   ctrl3, ctrl4, ctrl5
3. defined row names as gene1, gene2, gene3, gene4 and gene5
4. Computed the fold change for each gene.

Information on how to create DESeq2 objects and calculate fold change from 
matrix can be found here:
[DESeq2 analysis article](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html)

```{r}
library("DESeq2")
library("pheatmap")

# sample 50 random numbers to to make up the matrix
rand_nums <- sample(1:100, 50, replace = FALSE)

# create the 5 x 10 matrix
rand_matrix <- matrix(rand_nums, nrow = 5, ncol = 10)

# set the column names
colnames(rand_matrix) <- c("cond1", "cond2", "cond3", "cond4", "cond5", "ctrl1",
                           "ctrl2", "ctrl3", "ctrl4", "ctrl5")

# set the row names
rownames(rand_matrix) <- c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3", "gene4", "gene5")

# Create column to label which rows are represent conditions and which rows 
# represent controls in our original matrix
# We use a factor because that is the data type that the DESeq object wants and
# we auto convert the vector in a factor
data_compared <- base::factor(c("cond","cond","cond","cond","cond", "ctrl","ctrl","ctrl","ctrl","ctrl"))

# Here we create the a DESeqDataSet which is the DESeq object from our matrix
# countData is basically our matrix that we are converting
# colData is a dataframe where the rows represent the data_compared members and 
# thus needs to have the same number of rows as there are in the columns in the 
# countdata matrix and the same number of elements as the 
# Design is a factor datatype containing the columns in the original matrix to
# indicate which data is the control and which are the conditions
dds <- DESeq2::DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = rand_matrix, colData = DataFrame(data_compared), design = ~ data_compared)
dds <- DESeq2::DESeq(dds)

# Generate result table using result function which will contain the log2 fold 
# change among other data.
res <- DESeq2::results(dds)

# Print out log2 Fold Change values
res["log2FoldChange"]
